# Glossary

Defining words is a delicate and often contentious business!
Since we can't assume we've accomplished our goals in writing this glossary,
it may help the reader to know what those goals were:

1. To be a simple dictionary, explaining the meanings of words as used “in the wild”.
2. To illuminate distinctions and other relations between similar words.
3. To provide writers with read-to-use vocabulary; to spare people from re-naming established concepts,
   and, _very sparingly_, to encourage homogenization of vocabulary.


<div><!-- Some kinda javascript or Liquid or something to parse glossary.json into html...
I'm not at all convinced actually that json is an ideal medium, and rendering client-side via JS isn't my first choice either.
I actually did a similar thing years ago for another project entirely in Jeckyll, but it wasn't pretty. --></div>
